# RevolutTestApp

This is a sample app which loads currencies rates every second and shows them in a list

For the time-saving purpose, I haven't added flags images and countries' names as the API doesn't provide it.

## Libs, tools and approaches used in the app:

- Language: Kotlin
- Architecture: MVVM
- Network: Retrofit, Okhttp
- DI: Dagger2
- Architecture Components: ViewModel, LiveData
- Other: RxJava2, RecyclerView
- Tests: JUnit, Mockito
